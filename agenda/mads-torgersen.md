talkBlurb: |
    For much of its lifetime, C# was a proprietary, Windows-only, single-IDE language. No longer so! C# is designed in the open, its implementation is open source and it runs nearly everywhere. The “compiler” is an open API that understands and generates C# in real time, and can power any code editor you like. What happened? Let’s look at what “open” has come to mean for C#, and let’s do some pretty sick coding along the way!
