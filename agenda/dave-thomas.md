talkTitle: 10 Ways to Accelerate Software Delivery
talkBlurb: |
    A major dominant concern for most software development is how to increase the productivity of development; evolution and/or execution.  Systemic change in process and/or technology seldom result in more than an incremental impact on productivity and ROI.   Increased value is best achieved by targeting specific waste/opportunities in the value chain by introducing an innovative solution.  In this talk, we describe 10 techniques that are effective in accelerating software development.  We discuss how one identifies optimal change points to impact both new and legacy code.
