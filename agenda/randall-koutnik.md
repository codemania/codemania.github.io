speakerBio: |
    Randall is a senior software engineer at Netflix, building tools that wake up other Netflixers when things break.  To offset that karma, he's adopted a cat that wakes him up whenever a new JavaScript framework is released.  He doesn't get much sleep.<br/><br/>

talkTitle: What are observables and why should I care?
talkBlurb: |
    Learn about the next generation of asynchronous abstraction: Observables. Born of a cross between the Observer & Iterator patterns, observables are being used from Angular 2 to the data teams at Netflix & Microsoft. Start at a high level, learning why observables stand out among the many asynchronous abstractions available to the developer. Then, learn how to conceptualize event streams as simple observable flows when tackling typeaheads on the frontend. Finally, enter the world of machine learning and see how observables can be used for stream processing. Walk out with the confidence to harness the power of observables to straighten out your asynchronous apocalypse.
